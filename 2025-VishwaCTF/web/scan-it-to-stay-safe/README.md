# Soluce

We see that we can give an URL and it opens this url. So I started by creating a [requestbin](https://app.requestbin.net/) URL and I gave it to the challenge. 

It showed me that:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cz3e89hz1wg0000hycg0gxtzrrhyyyyyb.oast.pro
Accept: */*
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Flag: VishwaCTF{Y0u_7R4c30lI7_3000_4rK}
User-Agent: python-requests/2.31.0
```

So the flag is `VishwaCTF{Y0u_7R4c30lI7_3000_4rK}`.
