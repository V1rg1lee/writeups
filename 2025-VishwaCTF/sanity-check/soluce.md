# Challenge description

Let's get started and look at the bigger picture

# Soluce

When we put the text in Visual Studio Code in a String and we unzoom, we see the flag. We execute the code [here](code/sanity_check.py) to see distinctly the flag.

We can see the result [here](media/image.png).

Warning: To see the flag, you need to unzoom your terminal enough.
