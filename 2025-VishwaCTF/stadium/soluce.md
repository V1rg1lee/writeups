# Challenge description

My friend wanted to play a cricket match, he told me to find the best place to play a game. So I did. Can you identify the stadium where we played our match?

I took the image and put it on Google Image. I found that the stadium is the [Saling Cricket Stadium Ghanche](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=Ghanche+cricket+stadium).

So the flag is `VishwaCTF{Saling_Cricket_Stadium_Ghanche}`.
